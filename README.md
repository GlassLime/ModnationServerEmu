# ModnationServerEmu
A server emu for ModNation Racers

BombServer - Emulates the BombProof matchmaking server that is used by the game, this may work with LBPK without modifcation (though untested)

ModnationServer - Emulates the core HTTP server that stores creations and user stats

Emulation of the BombProof system is slow because of lack of documentation and packet logs (They're all SSL encrypted). All work so far on the matchmaking server has been done via reverse engineering the game executable (And as such progress on this will be SLOW)
